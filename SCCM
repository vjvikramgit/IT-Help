Creating a package in SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) involves several steps. Here's a general outline of the process:
1.	Prepare the Content: Before creating a package, ensure that you have the files or programs you want to deploy ready and accessible. This may involve creating installer files, scripts, or other content.
2.	Open the SCCM Console: Launch the SCCM console on your SCCM server or administrative workstation.
3.	Navigate to the Packages Node: In the SCCM console, navigate to the "Software Library" workspace, expand "Application Management," and then click on "Packages."
4.	Create a New Package: Right-click on "Packages" and select "Create Package."
5.	Enter Package Information: In the "General" tab of the "Create Package and Program Wizard," enter the following information:
•	Name: Provide a name for the package.
•	Description: Optionally, provide a description for the package.
•	Manufacturer: Enter the manufacturer's name.
•	Language: Select the appropriate language for the package.
6.	Specify Source Location: In the "Data Source" tab, specify the source location of the package files. This can be a network share accessible to SCCM.
7.	Distribute Content: After specifying the source location, distribute the content to distribution points. Right-click on the package, select "Distribute Content," and follow the wizard to distribute the content to distribution points.
8.	Create a Program: Once the package is created and content is distributed, you need to create a program to define how the package will be executed on client devices. Right-click on the package, select "Create Program," and follow the wizard to define program properties such as command-line options, requirements, and dependencies.
9.	Deploy the Package: After creating the program, deploy the package to the desired collection of devices. Right-click on the package, select "Deploy," and follow the wizard to specify deployment settings such as target collection, deployment schedule, and user notifications.
10.	Monitor Deployment: Monitor the deployment status in the SCCM console to ensure that the package is successfully deployed to client devices.
Keep in mind that the specific steps and options may vary depending on the version of SCCM you are using. It's also important to thoroughly test the package deployment in a lab environment before deploying it to production systems.
